124. [Bloc de notas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motorcycle_Diaries_(film)) from a 23yo life 

According to his daughter Aleida Guevara in a 2004 article, throughout the book, we can see how Guevara became aware that what poor people needed was not his scientific knowledge as a doctor, but his strength and persistence to bring social change

125. The perspectives of Karl Marx and Adam Smith on capitalism are indeed intriguing. Marx viewed capitalism as a Dionysian force due to its often chaotic and exploitative nature. He saw it as a system driven by the pursuit of profit, which could lead to inequality and social upheaval.

On the other hand, Adam Smith had a more Apollonian view of capitalism. He believed that while it might have its mysteries and complexities, its net effect was positive. Smith argued that through the pursuit of self-interest and the invisible hand of the market, capitalism could lead to prosperity, innovation, and overall societal benefits.

In a sense, Marx's perspective focused on the disruptive and tumultuous aspects of capitalism, while Smith's view emphasized its potential for order and prosperity. These differing viewpoints have fueled ongoing debates about the nature and impact of capitalism in society. Perhaps the real tragedy is in viewing capitalism from a *_single_* perspective; this yields winning or losing streaks but only for narrow time windows. The hypothesis and p-values don’t hold true over larger spans of time

133. AI is not a Tool: it’s an “Agent”, Teacher or Parent is “Principal”. We can then apply a checklist from Agency Theory to evaluate AI. This unique perspective allows for innovation and regulation in a familiar context

134. When we answer this, it becomes abundantly clear that AI can’t and shouldn’t replace teachers, at least in the foreseeable future. However, the checklist empowers parents, educators, and teachers to ask the right questions as AI is incorporated into education

135. Hierarchy: competitive advantage in innovation, production, regulation of AI chatbots & humanoid robots 🤖 

Based on current trajectories:
   - America may lead in LLMs. It’s an explicitly articulated goal. Other nations are not going to standby especially following the resounding success of ChatGPT
   - China in humanoid AI-powered robots. Apple CEO Tim Cook believes China has the highest density of skilled labor for this. Other nations may wish to catchup and compete 
   - Europe in regulating AI chatbots and robots. And here the EU as in other industries takes pride in leadership. Because EU is the largest market for most goods and services in the world, their role is mostly in influencing innovators and producers. So we provide a checklist for European regulators 

Our discussion is envisioning the world in 2034 as contrasted with the general discussion of this topic in response to ChatGPT:

   - Innovation: educators may be informed by our discussion on how to approach the innovators and engage them for the sake of education 
   - Production: recognize that the frenzy following chatbots are only the beginning. Humanoid AI-powered robots are coming and nations are going to push to have a competitive edge 
   - Regulation. Most regulators have no clue what they’re trying to regulate. So we provide a validated, generalizable approach that’s transparent and easy to adapt to education: agency theory

   136. Who a generalist is:

   - Truth:: No error
      - Bias 
      - Varience
      - Time

   - Knowledge:: Estimate of Truth
      - Point
      - Interval
      - Decision 

   - Ethics:: Good & Evil 
      - Observed/Descriptive 
      - Expected/Normative
      - Simulated/Metaethics

Controls/explains variance using hierarchical models, with longitudinal data as a powerful way to reveal variance. Remember: Truth only appears constant within limited time windows

137. Jada Pinket Hierarchal Language
   - Language
   - Code (UofB’more streets vs Hollywood)

   - Tokens (Variables to generalize) 
   -  Pro vs Amateur
