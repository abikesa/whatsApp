In his comprehensive biography of Dr. Kissinger, journalist Walter Isaacson came to the conclusion that he “had an instinctive feel for power and for creating a new global balance that could help America cope with its withdrawal syndrome after Vietnam. But it was not matched by a similar feel for the strength to be derived from the openness of America’s democratic system or for the moral values that are the true source of its global influence.”

Semantics or meaning are derived from the object upon which an agent acts. 
   - Is this a worthy adversary?
   - Can they requite? 
   - This is power & ethics 
   - Foucault & Chomsky 
   - $\text{Knowledge} = \alpha_{ijk} + \text{X}\beta_{ijk} + \epsilon_{ijk}$
      - $\alpha_{ijk}$, truth 
      - $\text{X}\beta_{ijk} + \epsilon_{ijk}$, error 
      - $\beta_{ijk}$: bias (means by level; $i$, individual; $j$, group; $k$, space-time)
      - $\epsilon_{ijk}$: variance (structured)
      - $\text{X}$: tokens of knowledge catalog 
         - known known 
         - known unknown 
         - unknown unknowns

“History presents *unambiguous* alternatives only in the rarest of circumstances,” he wrote in “Ending the Vietnam War,” published in 2003. “Most of the time, statesmen must strike a balance between their values and their necessities, or to put it another way, they are obliged to approach their goals not in one leap but in stages, each by definition imperfect by absolute standards. It is always possible to invoke that imperfection as an excuse to recoil before responsibilities, or as a pretext to indict one’s own society.”

Or as he put it more bluntly in another context, “Covert action should not be confused with missionary work.”
Thomas A. Schwartz of Vanderbilt University, who interviewed Dr. Kissinger late in life for his 2020 biography, found that even after decades of criticism, the former policymaker adhered to “his own philosophy of international relations, [which] held that in a tragic world, a statesman was not able to choose between good and evil but only among different forms of evil.”Or as he put it more bluntly in another context, “Covert action should not be confused with missionary work.”
